## Adding a New Skill

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new directory under `skills/` with your skill name
3. Include a `SKILL.md` with the skill definition (see existing skills for structure)
4. Include a `references/` directory if your skill needs supporting docs
5. Open a PR with a clear description of what the skill does and how you've tested it

## Skill Quality Standards

- **Battle-tested:** Skills should be tested against real-world friction, not just happy paths
- **Self-contained:** Each skill directory should include everything needed to operate
- **Decision trees over prompts:** Encode judgment, not just instructions
- **Failure recovery:** Document what to do when things break

## Reporting Issues
