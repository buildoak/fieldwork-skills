# agent-mux

`agent-mux` is a standalone project: https://github.com/buildoak/agent-mux

It provides a unified CLI for dispatching AI coding workers across multiple engines: Codex, Claude, and OpenCode.
Use one command with one JSON output contract regardless of engine.

For installation, usage docs, and the canonical `SKILL.md`, use the upstream repository:
- https://github.com/buildoak/agent-mux

This project depends on `agent-mux` for the `gsd-coordinator` orchestration workflow.
