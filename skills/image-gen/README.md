# image-gen

Five models, one pipeline, zero pip dependencies. This gallery is the proof -- same prompt pressure, different engines, real outputs.

Full runbook lives in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md). This page is just the receipts.

## Flux 2 Pro -- example 1 (~$0.05/image)

![Flux 2 Pro example 1](examples/flux-2-pro-example-1.jpg)

Flux 2 Pro. Clean composition, good texture discipline, minimal prompt wrestling -- the kind of result that makes you stop second-guessing the pipeline.

## Flux 2 Pro -- example 2 (~$0.05/image)

Same model, second swing. This is where I check consistency -- not just one lucky frame, but repeatable quality when the brief gets slightly weird.

## NanoBanana Pro -- example 1 (~$0.04/image)

NanoBanana Pro. Cheaper, sometimes moodier -- but when it lands, it lands with character you cannot fake in post.

P.S. I keep these images around because memory lies; files do not.
